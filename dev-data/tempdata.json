    "description": "A randomized heap is a heap that, through using randomization, allows to perform all operations in expected logarithmic time. A min heap is a binary tree in which the value of each vertex is less than or equal to the values of its children. Thus the minimum of the tree is always in the root vertex. A max heap can be defined in a similar way: by replacing less with greater",
